# Brick Jump

This is a simple game I created in unity to help me learn the program. It is an android game where the user taps the screen to jump a brick accross mulitple platforms to complete levels. Each level contains three stars that the player can collect throughout the level. The game also has an inifinite game mode were the user keeps jumping across the paltforms to try and get a new highscore.
